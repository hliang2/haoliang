</br >My name is Hao Liang (梁浩 in Chinese). I am a Ph.D. candidate at  [Rice University](https://https://www.rice.edu/), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Professor Guha Balakrishnan](https://www.guhabalakrishnan.com/). Before that, I obtained my M.S. from [Carnegie Mellon University](https://https://www.cmu.edu/) and my B.E. from [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://https://en.uestc.edu.cn/). I am interested in fairness and explainability of computer vision models, especially with applications in face analysis/recognition, and medical imaging. I am also broadly interested in generative models and distributed optimization.
